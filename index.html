                I'm a senior at the University of Pennsylvania and a proud alumnus of Central High School (go 275!). I
                am a candidate for a Bachelor of
                Science in Engineering degree from Penn Engineering. I am majoring in computer science with a minor in
                mathematics.
                Some of my coursework includes Algorithmic Game Theory, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Data
                Structures and Algorithms, Scalable
                and Cloud Computing, Databases and Information Systems, Software Design, Discrete Mathematics, Number
                Theory, as well as Automata, Computability,
                and Complexity. As of late, the projects that have given me the most joy have involved full-stack
                development. I very much enjoy getting to
                work on all aspects of a project. I am comfortable with Java, HTML, Node.js, C, LaTeX, SQL, Git, Agile
                Development
                (Scrum), as well as Amazon EMR. I am a
                beginner at Python, OCaml, React, MongoDB, and C++. My interests currently lie in algorithm
                design, game theory, software optimization, and humanitarian software development. Namely, one of the
                things I am
                most passionate about is making computer science both more accessible and more approachable. Upon
                completion of my degree, I will be a full-time software
                developer at <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com" target="_blank">Publicis Sapient</a>, in the
                company's Chicago office.

                My current outlook on engineering has been
                largely shaped by the time I spent in Rwanda this past summer. This time was spent at the
                Gashora Girls Academy of Science and Technology, teaching computer science and helping students with a
                handful of their own projects.
                One of the most notable projects was using a Raspberry Pi to automate a hydroponic tomato garden (it is
                very difficult to get
                tomatoes to grow naturally in Rwanda, given the climate). My time at the academy left me with an
                understanding of the impact computer science
                can have on the lives of others. Now that I am getting ready to start my professional career, I am eager
                to design software that
                leaves a positive impact on the world and on those around me.
